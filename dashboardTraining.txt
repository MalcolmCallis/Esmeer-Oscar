This file explains how to do basic operations on the dashboard. It is not comprehensive, but is meant to explain the 
non-intuitive parts of the dashboard.

Creating a partner:

The page to manage partners can be found under the Fulfillment -> Partners tab.
To create a partner, click the create new partner button.
Then, fill in the name, image (which is the logo of the partner), description, and address of the partner.
The fields on the address that are mandatory are address 1, city, state, zip code, and country.
Then click Save. The partner should be created. 

Linking a user to a partner:

Once the partner is created, they will appear in the table on the partners page in the dashboard.
To edit a partner's details, go to the far left cell in the partners' row and select the appropriate option in the button menu.
Once editing a partner, it is easy to create a new user and add it to the partner or add an existing user.

To add a product:

In order to add a product, there has to be at least one partner created.
Go to the Catalog -> Partners tab in the dashboard, and select create new product.


Explanation of Categories:
Categories are a way that Esmeer divides products into similar product types, such as Hats, T-shirts, and spaceships.
Each Partner automatically has a Category created for them, and they can create new Categories off of their category.
The categories are seen on the site by the customer as ways to visually search for products.
