Before running anything, Oscar requires virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper to be installed. To do this:

0. run pip install django-oscar

1. run pip install virtualenv

2. run pip install virtualenvwrapper

3. Open .basrc (or whatever your shell startup file is, i.e .profile, etc) in a text editor (located in source "~/.bashrc")

4. Add the following three lines to the shell startup file:
	export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
	export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel
	source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

5. Navigate to the Esmeer-Oscar folder

6. run mkvirtualenv oscar

7. run workon oscar

Now that virtualenv has been set up, make sure that your database is completely empty and named 'production' with no username or password. To ensure this, do the following:

1. run mysql

2. Enter drop database production;

3. Finally, enter create database production;

If all the steps were successful thusfar:

1. Navigate to the EsmeerOscar folder and run python manage.py migrate

2. Now run the server (python manage.py runserver)

Note: If you have issues with the migration concerning the mysqldb database, it's because virtualenv has no idea what you had installed on your system prior apparently. I also had issues installing the python mysql package via pip. Here's how I fixed it:

1. apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

2. pip install mysql-python

Awesome. So we have the site up now. It's beautiful, right? RIGHT?

...Ahem. Now to populate the database with the countries of the world...

1. pip install pycountry (if you don't already have it)

Note: Before running this next step, it's important to note that, by default, the next command will mark all countries as shipping countries. If you call it with the --no-shipping option, it will not mark any of them as shipping so it will need to be marked manually.

2. python manage.py oscar_populate_countries --no-shipping

After running the above command you will need to open up mysql and manually add
	update production.address_country set is_shipping_country=1 where name ="United States of America";
	update production.django_site set name="esmeer.com";
	update production.django_site set domain="esmeer.com";


All of the necessary steps to start this from scratch (and what I personally used to set this up) can be found here:

run pip install pillow

sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev

Have a nice freakin' day. :)

UPDATE!!

When pulling master, it is now necessary to install certain packages to enable Paypal support.

1. Make sure you are in your virtual environment. Run "pip install django-oscar-paypal".
2. After successful installation, run "python manage.py syncdb"

NOTE -- There is currently an issue with product images that has not yet been addressed that is almost certainly related
to this integration.
